Instructions for recovering DJI flight logs:
Ben Cook - 25/02/2021
============================================

Raw flight logs are stored on the android device connected to the DJI transmitter.
When connecting the android device to PC ensure that the permissions are set on the device to transfer files.

They can be found in this directory on he device:

\Internal storage\DJI\dji.pilot\FlightRecord\

The format of the file name is as follows:

DJIFlightRecord_2020-12-08_[15-35-17].txt

The files are saved in a compressed format to are unintelliigable to humans. However, they can be converted into a more useful format using the tool on this web page:

https://www.phantomhelp.com/logviewer/upload/

locate and upload the raw flight log file. Wait a few moments for the tool to convert it. data is then displayed on a web page, which you can share by sending the URL of others.

This data can be downloaded as either a KML file format (for viewing track data in Google Earth etc), or as a CSV file for analysis.
Recommend downloading the Verbose CSV file, by hitting 'Download Verbose CSV'.
This then sends a zip file to your downloads area:

DJIFlightRecord_2019-12-17_[15-43-22]csv-verbose.zip

this contains the following file:

DJIFlightRecord_2019-12-17_[15-43-22]-TxtLogToCsv.csv

This file can be opened in MS Excel, etc.

Useful data can be found in the following columns:

OSD.latitude		(Col M)		Latitude of drone position
OSD.longitude		(Col N)		Longitude of drone position

HOME.latitude		(Col GF)	Latitude of launch position (fixed)
HOME.longitude		(Col GG)	Longitude of launch position (fixed)

OSD.flyTime [s] 	(Col BH) 	Elapsed time in seconds (to 0.1 s accuracy)

CUSTOM.updateTime 	(Col A)		UTC Timestamp - decimal floating point number of days since  1 January 1900, 00:00:00 (UTC time), to ms resolution

OSD.height [m] 		(Col O)		Col Height above Ground Level (AGL) in m, with reference to launch point altitude

OSD.groundOrSky 	(Col AB)	Binary flag indicating whether the drone is on the ground, or is airborne ('Ground' or 'Sky')
